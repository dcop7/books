## Book Overview

**"The Platform Engineering Book"** by Michael Levan represents a pioneering effort in codifying and systematizing the emerging discipline of Platform Engineering. Published as a living document on Leanpub, this comprehensive guide addresses one of the most significant shifts in modern software development and infrastructure management practices.

### Core Premise

The book tackles the fundamental challenge that many organizations face today: the creation and management of integrated capabilities that are implemented according to what the platform user needs (the platform user is the internal engineer/developer using the platform) via self-service capabilities. This definition encapsulates the essence of Platform Engineering as both a technical discipline and an organizational methodology.

Platform Engineering, as Levan presents it, is not merely another buzzword in the ever-evolving technology landscape. Instead, it represents a maturation of practices that have existed for years but are now receiving proper recognition and systematic implementation. The book positions Platform Engineering as a natural evolution from traditional DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices, addressing the growing complexity of modern software delivery pipelines and the need for more sophisticated internal tooling.

### Publishing Philosophy

One of the most innovative aspects of this book is its "living document" approach. This book lives on! Yes, one of the greatest things about an eBook is that it can be updated at any time. Because Platform Engineering as a team is so new and emerging, standards and best practices will constantly change. That's why this eBook will be updated all of the time as new information and best practices come out! This methodology reflects the dynamic nature of the field and ensures that readers receive the most current information and practices.

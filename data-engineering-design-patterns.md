## Executive Summary

Data Engineering Design Patterns by Bartosz Konieczny is a comprehensive hands-on guide that addresses the reality that data projects are an intrinsic part of an organization's technical ecosystem, but data engineers in many companies continue to work on problems that others have already solved. This practical book provides valuable insights by focusing on various critical aspects of data engineering, including data ingestion, data quality, idempotency, and much more.

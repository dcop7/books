## Chapter 1: Computer Networks and the Internet

### 1.1 What Is the Internet?

The chapter begins by defining the Internet from two perspectives: as a nuts-and-bolts description and as a service description. The Internet is described as a network of networks, connecting billions of computing devices worldwide.

**Key Components:**
- **End Systems (Hosts)**: Desktop computers, servers, mobile devices, IoT devices
- **Communication Links**: Fiber optics, copper wire, radio spectrum, satellite
- **Packet Switches**: Routers and link-layer switches that forward packets
- **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**: Provide Internet access to end systems

**Protocols:** The Internet runs on protocols that define the format and order of messages exchanged between network entities. The primary protocol suite is TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).

### 1.2 The Network Edge

The network edge consists of end systems and the access networks that connect them to the first router on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.

**Access Network Types:**
- **Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)**: Uses existing telephone lines
- **Cable Internet Access**: Utilizes cable television infrastructure
- **Fiber to the Home (FTTH)**: Direct fiber optic connections
- **Satellite Internet**: For remote areas where terrestrial access is unavailable
- **Ethernet and WiFi**: Local area network technologies

**Physical Media:**
- **Guided Media**: Twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable, fiber optics
- **Unguided Media**: Terrestrial radio, satellite radio

### 1.3 The Network Core

The network core is the mesh of interconnected routers that forms the backbone of the Internet. Two fundamental approaches to moving data through the network core are:

**Circuit Switching:**
- Dedicated communication path between two nodes
- Resources reserved for the entire duration of communication
- Example: Traditional telephone networks
- Advantages: Guaranteed performance, no congestion
- Disadvantages: Inefficient resource utilization

**Packet Switching:**
- Data broken into packets transmitted independently
- No dedicated path; packets may take different routes
- Store-and-forward transmission principle
- Advantages: Efficient resource sharing, robust to failures
- Disadvantages: Variable delays, potential packet loss

**Network of Networks:**
The Internet is structured as a hierarchy of ISPs:
- **Tier-1 ISPs**: Global coverage, peer with each other
- **Regional ISPs**: Connect to Tier-1 ISPs
- **Access ISPs**: Provide local Internet access
- **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)**: Locations where ISPs interconnect
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Bring content closer to users

### 1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput

Understanding network performance requires analyzing several key metrics:

**Types of Delay:**
1. **Processing Delay**: Time to examine packet header and determine output link
2. **Queuing Delay**: Time packet waits in output buffer
3. **Transmission Delay**: Time to push all packet bits onto the link
4. **Propagation Delay**: Time for signal to travel from source to destination

**Packet Loss:**
Occurs when packets arrive at a full queue buffer and are dropped.

**Throughput:**
- **Instantaneous Throughput**: Rate at which data is received at any instant
- **Average Throughput**: Average rate over a longer period
- **Bottleneck Link**: The link with the lowest transmission rate in an end-to-end path

### 1.5 Protocol Layers and Service Models

The complexity of networking is managed through layering, where each layer provides services to the layer above and uses services from the layer below.

**Internet Protocol Stack:**
1. **Application Layer**: Network applications and protocols (HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS)
2. **Transport Layer**: Process-to-process data transfer (TCP, UDP)
3. **Network Layer**: Routing of datagrams from source to destination (IP)
4. **Link Layer**: Data transfer between neighboring network elements (Ethernet, WiFi)
5. **Physical Layer**: Transmission of individual bits over physical media

**Encapsulation:**
Each layer adds its own header information to the data from the layer above, creating a layered structure that enables proper processing at each network node.

### 1.6 Networks Under Attack

Security threats to computer networks include:
- **Malware**: Viruses, worms, trojan horses
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**: Overwhelming network resources
- **Packet Sniffing**: Intercepting and analyzing network traffic
- **IP Spoofing**: Falsifying source IP addresses

## Chapter 2: Application Layer

### 2.1 Principles of Network Applications

Network applications run on end systems and communicate over the network. The chapter establishes fundamental principles for understanding how network applications work.

**Network Application Architectures:**
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Centralized servers serve multiple clients
  - Always-on host (server)
  - Clients communicate with server
  - Examples: Web, email, file transfer
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**: Direct communication between end systems
  - Minimal reliance on dedicated servers
  - Self-scalability
  - Examples: BitTorrent, Skype

**Process Communication:**
- **Process**: Program running within a host
- **Inter-process Communication**: Within same host uses OS-defined mechanisms
- **Network Communication**: Between different hosts uses sockets
- **Socket**: Interface between application and transport layer

**Transport Services Available:**
- **Reliable Data Transfer**: Guarantees error-free, in-order delivery
- **Throughput**: Bandwidth guarantees
- **Timing**: Low-delay guarantees
- **Security**: Encryption and authentication

### 2.2 The Web and HTTP

The World Wide Web is a distributed information system built on top of the Internet using HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).

**HTTP Overview:**
- **Application-layer protocol**: Defines message format and exchange rules
- **Client-Server Model**: Web browsers (clients) request pages from web servers
- **Stateless Protocol**: Server maintains no information about past client requests
- **Uses TCP**: Reliable transport protocol on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS)

**HTTP Message Format:**

**HTTP Request Message:**
```
GET /path/to/file HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
```

**HTTP Response Message:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2023 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.1
Content-Length: 3847
Content-Type: text/html

[HTML content follows]
```

**HTTP Methods:**
- **GET**: Retrieve information from server
- **POST**: Submit data to server for processing
- **HEAD**: Like GET but returns only headers
- **PUT**: Upload file to server
- **DELETE**: Delete file from server

**HTTP Response Status Codes:**
- **1xx**: Informational
- **2xx**: Success (200 OK, 201 Created)
- **3xx**: Redirection (301 Moved Permanently, 304 Not Modified)
- **4xx**: Client Error (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)
- **5xx**: Server Error (500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable)

**Cookies:**
Mechanism for maintaining state in stateless HTTP:
1. Cookie header line in HTTP response message
2. Cookie header line in HTTP request message
3. Cookie file maintained on user's end system
4. Back-end database at website

**Web Caching (Proxy Servers):**
Network entity that satisfies HTTP requests on behalf of origin web server:
- **Advantages**: Reduced response time, reduced traffic on institution's access link
- **Cache Hit**: Requested object found in cache
- **Cache Miss**: Requested object not in cache, must be fetched from origin server
- **Conditional GET**: Uses If-Modified-Since header to check for updates

### 2.3 Electronic Mail (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)

Email is one of the Internet's most popular applications, involving multiple components and protocols.

**Email System Components:**
- **User Agents**: Allow users to read, reply, forward, save, and compose messages
- **Mail Servers**: Core of email infrastructure, manage and store messages
- **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**: Internet's principal mail protocol

**SMTP Protocol:**
- **Push Protocol**: Sender pushes file to receiver
- **Uses TCP**: Reliable transport on port 25
- **Three Phases**: Handshaking, message transfer, closure
- **Command-Response Interaction**: Similar to HTTP but push rather than pull

**Mail Access Protocols:**
- **Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3)**: Download-and-delete or download-and-keep
- **Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)**: Allows user to organize messages on server
- **HTTP**: Web-based email (Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo Mail)

### 2.4 DNS—The Internet's Directory Service

The Domain Name System (DNS) provides hostname-to-IP address translation and other services.

**DNS Services:**
- **Hostname to IP Address Translation**: Primary function
- **Host Aliasing**: Canonical and alias names
- **Mail Server Aliasing**: MX records for email routing
- **Load Distribution**: Multiple IP addresses for replicated servers

**DNS Hierarchy:**
- **Root DNS Servers**: Top of hierarchy, 13 logical root servers worldwide
- **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers**: .com, .org, .net, country codes
- **Authoritative DNS Servers**: Organization's own DNS servers
- **Local DNS Servers**: Not strictly part of hierarchy but crucial for resolution

**DNS Resolution Process:**
1. **Recursive Query**: Local DNS server queries on behalf of requesting host
2. **Iterative Query**: Contacted server replies with name of next server to contact
3. **DNS Caching**: Improves delay performance and reduces DNS message traffic

**DNS Records:**
Resource records stored in DNS databases:
- **Type A**: Hostname to IP address mapping
- **Type NS**: Domain to authoritative name server mapping
- **Type CNAME**: Alias hostname to canonical hostname mapping
- **Type MX**: Mail server for domain

### 2.5 Peer-to-Peer File Distribution

P2P systems allow peers to communicate directly without always-on server infrastructure.

**P2P vs. Client-Server Distribution:**
- **Scalability**: P2P systems naturally scale with number of peers
- **Distribution Time**: For large files, P2P can be significantly faster
- **Self-scaling**: As more peers join, total system capacity increases

**BitTorrent Protocol:**
Popular P2P file-sharing protocol:
- **Torrent**: Group of peers participating in distribution of particular file
- **Tracker**: Infrastructure node that tracks peers in torrent
- **Chunks**: Files divided into fixed-length segments

## Chapter 3: Transport Layer

### 3.1 Introduction and Transport-Layer Services

The transport layer provides logical communication between application processes running on different hosts, extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery.

**Transport vs. Network Layer:**
- **Network Layer**: Logical communication between hosts
- **Transport Layer**: Logical communication between processes
- **Transport Layer Protocol**: Runs in end systems, not in routers

**Internet Transport Protocols:**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Reliable, connection-oriented service
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Unreliable, connectionless service

### 3.2 Multiplexing and Demultiplexing

Transport layer multiplexing/demultiplexing extends host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Multiplexing**: Gathering data from multiple sockets, encapsulating with header
- **Demultiplexing**: Delivering received segments to correct socket
- **Port Numbers**: 16-bit identifiers for processes

**Port Number Ranges:**
- **Well-Known Ports (0-1023)**: Reserved for standard services (HTTP:80, HTTPS:443, SMTP:25)
- **Registered Ports (1024-49151)**: Assigned to specific applications
- **Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535)**: Available for general use

**Connection-oriented vs. Connectionless:**
- **UDP**: Uses only destination port for demultiplexing
- **TCP**: Uses four-tuple (source IP, source port, dest IP, dest port)

### 3.3 Connectionless Transport: UDP

UDP provides basic transport layer functionality with minimal overhead.

**UDP Characteristics:**
- **Connectionless**: No handshaking before sending
- **Unreliable**: No guarantee of delivery or ordering
- **Lightweight**: Minimal header overhead (8 bytes)
- **Fast**: No connection establishment delay

**UDP Header Format:**
```
0                   1                   2                   3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|          Source Port          |       Destination Port        |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|            Length             |          Checksum             |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                             Data                              |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

### 3.4 Principles of Reliable Data Transfer

Reliable data transfer is fundamental to many network applications. This section builds understanding through increasingly sophisticated protocols.

**Reliable Data Transfer Protocol Stack:**
- **rdt1.0**: Reliable transfer over reliable channel (theoretical)
- **rdt2.0**: Channel with bit errors (uses checksums, ACKs, NAKs)
- **rdt2.1**: Handles corrupted ACKs/NAKs (adds sequence numbers)
- **rdt2.2**: NAK-free protocol (duplicate ACKs indicate errors)
- **rdt3.0**: Channels with errors and loss (adds timeouts)

**Key Mechanisms:**
- **Error Detection**: Checksums to detect bit errors
- **Receiver Feedback**: ACK/NAK messages
- **Retransmission**: Resend corrupted or lost packets
- **Sequence Numbers**: Handle duplicates
- **Timeouts**: Detect and recover from lost packets

**Pipelined Protocols:**
To improve utilization, multiple packets sent before waiting for acknowledgments:
- **Go-Back-N (GBN)**: Sender maintains window of up to N unacknowledged packets
- **Selective Repeat (SR)**: Receiver acknowledges correctly received packets individually

### 3.5 Connection-Oriented Transport: TCP

TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented service between processes.

**TCP Characteristics:**
- **Connection-oriented**: Handshaking initializes sender/receiver state
- **Reliable**: Data delivered without errors, in correct order
- **Full-duplex**: Bi-directional data flow
- **Point-to-point**: Between single sender and single receiver
- **Flow Control**: Receiver controls sender's transmission rate
- **Congestion Control**: Sender controls rate based on network congestion

**TCP Segment Structure:**
```
0                   1                   2                   3
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

**TCP Connection Management:**

**Three-Way Handshake (Connection Establishment):**
1. **SYN**: Client sends SYN segment with initial sequence number
2. **SYN-ACK**: Server responds with SYN-ACK segment
3. **ACK**: Client acknowledges server's SYN

**Connection Termination:**
1. **FIN**: One side initiates close with FIN segment
2. **ACK**: Other side acknowledges FIN
3. **FIN**: Other side sends its own FIN
4. **ACK**: Original closer acknowledges second FIN

**TCP Reliable Data Transfer:**
- **Sequence Numbers**: Byte-stream number of first byte in segment
- **Acknowledgment Numbers**: Sequence number of next byte expected
- **Cumulative ACKs**: ACK up to first missing byte
- **Timeout/Retransmission**: Retransmit unacknowledged segments
- **Fast Retransmit**: Resend after three duplicate ACKs

### 3.6 Principles of Congestion Control

Congestion occurs when too many sources send data too fast for network to handle.

**Manifestations of Congestion:**
- **Lost Packets**: Buffer overflow at routers
- **Long Delays**: Queuing delays increase
- **Wasted Resources**: Retransmissions consume capacity

**Congestion Control Approaches:**
- **End-to-End**: Congestion inferred from observed loss and delay
- **Network-Assisted**: Routers provide feedback to end systems

**Costs of Congestion:**
- **Retransmissions**: Waste network capacity
- **Upstream Transmission Capacity**: Wasted when packets dropped downstream
- **Multi-hop Path Waste**: Entire path capacity wasted when packet dropped

### 3.7 TCP Congestion Control

TCP uses end-to-end congestion control based on packet loss inference.

**Key Variables:**
- **cwnd**: Congestion window size
- **ssthresh**: Slow start threshold
- **LastByteSent - LastByteAcked ≤ min{cwnd, rwnd}**

**TCP Congestion Control Algorithm:**

**Slow Start:**
- **Initial Phase**: cwnd starts at 1 MSS
- **Exponential Growth**: cwnd doubles every RTT
- **Continues Until**: Loss detected or cwnd reaches ssthresh

**Congestion Avoidance:**
- **Linear Growth**: Increase cwnd by 1 MSS every RTT
- **Additive Increase**: Conservative growth phase

**Fast Recovery:**
- **After Fast Retransmit**: cwnd reduced to half
- **Linear Growth**: Return to congestion avoidance

**TCP Congestion Control Phases:**
1. **Slow Start**: Exponential growth until loss or threshold
2. **Congestion Avoidance**: Linear growth
3. **Fast Recovery**: Respond to congestion without slow start

**TCP Fairness:**
Multiple TCP connections sharing bottleneck link converge to equal bandwidth shares through additive increase, multiplicative decrease mechanism.

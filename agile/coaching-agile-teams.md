"Coaching Agile Teams" is a seminal work that bridges the gap between traditional project management and agile methodologies through the lens of professional coaching. Lyssa Adkins, a renowned agile coach and trainer, presents a comprehensive guide that transforms how we think about leading and supporting agile teams. The book introduces the concept of the agile coach as a distinct role that combines facilitation, mentoring, teaching, and professional coaching to help teams achieve high performance and sustainable practices.

## Author Background

Lyssa Adkins is a pioneering figure in the agile community with extensive experience in agile coaching, training, and organizational transformation. She is the founder of the Agile Coaching Institute and has been instrumental in defining the profession of agile coaching. Her work has influenced thousands of practitioners worldwide, and she is recognized as one of the foremost authorities on agile coaching practices. Adkins brings both theoretical knowledge and practical experience from her years of coaching teams across various industries and organizational contexts.

## Part I: The Agile Coach

### Chapter 1: Will I Be a Good Agile Coach?

The opening chapter addresses the fundamental question that many aspiring agile coaches face: whether they have what it takes to be effective in this role. Adkins begins by distinguishing agile coaching from traditional project management and other leadership roles. She emphasizes that agile coaching requires a unique blend of skills, mindset, and personal qualities that go far beyond technical knowledge of agile frameworks.

The chapter explores the personal characteristics that make for effective agile coaches, including emotional intelligence, patience, curiosity, and the ability to hold space for team learning and growth. Adkins introduces the concept of "being with" teams rather than "doing to" them, highlighting the collaborative and supportive nature of agile coaching versus directive management styles.

Key themes include the importance of self-awareness for coaches, the need to continuously learn and adapt, and the challenge of maintaining objectivity while being deeply invested in team success. The chapter also addresses common fears and concerns that new coaches face, such as imposter syndrome and the pressure to have all the answers immediately.

Adkins presents a self-assessment framework that helps readers evaluate their readiness for agile coaching, covering areas such as communication skills, conflict resolution abilities, systems thinking, and personal resilience. She emphasizes that becoming an effective agile coach is a journey rather than a destination, requiring ongoing development and refinement of skills.

### Chapter 2: Expect High Performance

This chapter challenges readers to raise their expectations and believe in the potential of agile teams to achieve extraordinary results. Adkins argues that many teams settle for mediocrity because their coaches and leaders don't expect or facilitate high performance. She introduces the concept of creating conditions where teams can naturally evolve toward excellence.

The discussion covers the psychological and environmental factors that enable high performance, including psychological safety, clear purpose, appropriate challenge levels, and continuous learning opportunities. Adkins explains how coaches can create these conditions through their words, actions, and the systems they help establish.

The chapter delves into the characteristics of high-performing agile teams, such as shared accountability, collective ownership, rapid learning cycles, and the ability to self-organize effectively. Adkins provides practical strategies for coaches to help teams recognize their potential and work toward achieving it.

A significant portion of the chapter is dedicated to overcoming common obstacles to high performance, including fear of failure, blame cultures, micromanagement, and lack of clear goals. The author presents case studies and examples that illustrate how skilled coaching can transform struggling teams into high-performing units.

The concept of "holding the team's greatness" is introduced, which involves the coach maintaining unwavering belief in the team's potential even during difficult periods. This psychological support provides teams with the confidence and motivation needed to push through challenges and achieve breakthrough performance.

### Chapter 3: Form a Guiding Coalition

Drawing inspiration from John Kotter's change management principles, this chapter focuses on building support for agile transformation beyond the immediate team level. Adkins recognizes that sustainable agile adoption requires buy-in and active support from multiple stakeholders across the organization.

The chapter provides detailed guidance on identifying key stakeholders who can influence the success of agile initiatives, including senior leaders, middle management, product owners, and influential team members. Adkins explains how to assess stakeholder readiness and develop strategies for engaging each group effectively.

Practical techniques for building coalition support include storytelling, demonstrating quick wins, addressing concerns proactively, and creating opportunities for stakeholders to experience agile benefits firsthand. The author emphasizes the importance of patience and persistence in coalition building, as organizational change often requires time and repeated exposure to new ideas.

The discussion includes strategies for dealing with resistance and skepticism, common challenges that agile coaches face when introducing new practices. Adkins provides frameworks for understanding different types of resistance and tailored approaches for addressing each type constructively.

The chapter also covers the ongoing maintenance of coalition support, including regular communication, celebrating successes, and adapting strategies based on feedback and changing circumstances. The author stresses that coalition building is not a one-time activity but an ongoing responsibility of agile coaches.

### Chapter 4: Create Safety

Psychological safety emerges as a foundational requirement for agile team success in this chapter. Adkins draws on research by Amy Edmondson and others to demonstrate how safety enables learning, innovation, and high performance. The chapter provides comprehensive guidance on creating and maintaining safe environments for agile teams.

The discussion begins with an exploration of what safety means in an agile context, including the freedom to make mistakes, ask questions, challenge ideas, and experiment with new approaches. Adkins explains how safety differs from comfort, emphasizing that safe environments can and should include appropriate levels of challenge and stretch.

Practical strategies for creating safety include establishing team agreements, modeling vulnerable behavior as a coach, addressing conflicts constructively, and creating rituals and practices that reinforce safety. The chapter provides specific techniques for different types of team interactions, from daily standups to retrospectives.

The author addresses common threats to team safety, including blame cultures, perfectionism, hierarchical power dynamics, and external pressures. Strategies for protecting teams from these threats while helping them build resilience are discussed in detail.

A significant portion of the chapter focuses on helping teams develop their own safety-creating behaviors and systems. Adkins emphasizes that while coaches can initially create safety, teams must ultimately take ownership of maintaining and strengthening their safe environment.

## Part II: Agile Coaching Defined

### Chapter 5: What Is Agile Coaching?

This foundational chapter provides a comprehensive definition of agile coaching and distinguishes it from related disciplines. Adkins presents agile coaching as a unique profession that combines elements of mentoring, facilitating, teaching, and professional coaching to help teams and organizations adopt agile practices effectively.

The chapter introduces the Agile Coaching Competency Framework, which outlines the key skills and knowledge areas that agile coaches need to develop. This framework includes technical agile knowledge, coaching skills, facilitation abilities, mentoring capabilities, and teaching skills. Adkins explains how these competencies work together to create effective coaching interventions.

The discussion covers the evolution of agile coaching as a distinct profession, tracing its development from early agile adoption through to the current sophisticated understanding of coaching practices. The author explains how agile coaching has grown beyond simply teaching agile frameworks to encompass broader organizational transformation and team development.

Different coaching stances and when to use them are explored in detail, including teaching (when teams need new knowledge), mentoring (when teams need guidance based on experience), facilitating (when teams need help with processes), and professional coaching (when teams need to discover their own solutions). Adkins provides guidance on recognizing which stance is most appropriate in different situations.

The chapter also addresses common misconceptions about agile coaching, such as the belief that coaches are responsible for team success or that coaching is simply a softer form of management. The author clarifies the true nature of coaching relationships and the shared accountability between coaches and teams.

### Chapter 6: Coaching Catalysts

This chapter introduces the concept of coaching catalysts - interventions and techniques that accelerate team learning and improvement. Adkins presents a comprehensive toolkit of catalysts that coaches can use to help teams overcome obstacles and achieve their goals more effectively.

The discussion begins with an explanation of how catalysts work, drawing parallels with chemical catalysts that speed up reactions without being consumed in the process. Agile coaching catalysts similarly accelerate team development without creating dependency on the coach.

Major categories of coaching catalysts are explored, including powerful questions, observations, experiments, and challenges. Each category is explained with specific examples and guidance on when and how to use different types of catalysts effectively.

The chapter provides detailed guidance on crafting powerful questions that help teams think more deeply about their practices and challenges. Adkins explains the difference between questions that lead teams toward predetermined solutions and those that genuinely open up new possibilities for exploration.

Observation-based catalysts are discussed, including how coaches can share their observations in ways that promote team reflection and learning. The author provides frameworks for delivering observations that are specific, actionable, and non-judgmental.

The concept of coaching experiments is introduced as a way to help teams try new approaches in low-risk ways. Adkins provides guidance on designing experiments that are likely to generate useful learning regardless of their immediate success or failure.

### Chapter 7: Coaching Challenges

Building on the previous chapter, this section delves deeper into the use of challenges as coaching tools. Adkins explains how appropriate challenges can stretch teams beyond their comfort zones and accelerate their development toward high performance.

The chapter begins by distinguishing between supportive challenges that promote growth and destructive challenges that create fear or overwhelm. The author provides frameworks for assessing team readiness for different types of challenges and calibrating the level of stretch appropriately.

Various types of challenges are explored, including process challenges (trying new agile practices), performance challenges (setting ambitious goals), and learning challenges (acquiring new skills or knowledge). Each type is discussed with specific examples and guidance on implementation.

The timing and delivery of challenges are covered in detail, including how to present challenges in ways that motivate rather than intimidate teams. Adkins emphasizes the importance of providing adequate support alongside challenges to ensure teams have the resources they need to succeed.

The chapter addresses how to handle situations where teams resist or struggle with challenges, providing strategies for adjusting approaches while maintaining momentum toward improvement. The author stresses the importance of learning from both successful and unsuccessful challenges.

Follow-up and support strategies are discussed, including how coaches can help teams process their experiences with challenges and extract maximum learning value. The chapter emphasizes that the learning process is often more valuable than the immediate results of meeting specific challenges.

## Part III: The Roles of an Agile Coach

### Chapter 8: The Teacher

This chapter explores the teaching aspect of agile coaching, recognizing that coaches often need to impart new knowledge and skills to teams adopting agile practices. Adkins distinguishes between traditional didactic teaching and the more interactive, experiential teaching approaches that work best in agile environments.

The discussion begins with an analysis of when teaching is the most appropriate coaching stance, typically when teams lack fundamental knowledge or skills needed to progress. The author provides guidance on recognizing these situations and transitioning smoothly into teaching mode when necessary.

Adult learning principles are explored in depth, with specific application to agile team contexts. Adkins explains how to make learning relevant, engaging, and immediately applicable, drawing on research about how adults learn most effectively.

Various teaching techniques suitable for agile coaching are presented, including storytelling, demonstrations, hands-on exercises, and experiential learning activities. Each technique is explained with practical examples and guidance on implementation.

The chapter addresses how to teach agile concepts in ways that promote understanding rather than mere compliance. Adkins emphasizes the importance of helping teams understand the principles behind agile practices rather than simply following prescribed procedures.

Strategies for dealing with different learning styles and preferences within teams are discussed, including how to ensure that all team members have opportunities to learn in ways that work best for them. The author provides techniques for making learning inclusive and accessible.

The transition from teaching to other coaching stances is covered, including how to recognize when teams have absorbed enough knowledge to begin practicing independently and when continued teaching might create dependency rather than capability.

### Chapter 9: The Mentor

Mentoring represents another key aspect of agile coaching, involving the sharing of experience and wisdom to help teams navigate challenges and opportunities. This chapter explores how agile coaches can effectively mentor teams while avoiding the pitfall of creating dependency.

The discussion begins with a definition of mentoring in the agile coaching context, distinguishing it from teaching (sharing knowledge) and coaching (facilitating discovery). Mentoring involves sharing experience-based insights and guidance drawn from the coach's own journey and observations of other teams.

The chapter explores when mentoring is most appropriate, typically when teams are facing situations similar to ones the coach has encountered before. Adkins provides guidance on recognizing these opportunities and sharing experience in ways that promote team learning rather than simply providing solutions.

Different mentoring approaches are discussed, including storytelling, sharing lessons learned, providing perspective on challenges, and offering guidance on potential pitfalls. Each approach is explained with examples and implementation guidance.

The balance between sharing experience and promoting team discovery is addressed throughout the chapter. Adkins emphasizes that effective mentoring helps teams learn from others' experiences while still developing their own problem-solving capabilities.

The chapter covers how to mentor teams through common agile adoption challenges, including resistance to change, scaling difficulties, and integration with existing organizational systems. Practical strategies for each type of challenge are provided.

Strategies for avoiding mentor trap scenarios are discussed, including situations where teams become overly dependent on mentor guidance or where mentors impose their own preferred solutions rather than helping teams find their own paths.

### Chapter 10: The Facilitator

Facilitation skills are essential for agile coaches, who frequently guide team meetings, ceremonies, and planning sessions. This chapter provides comprehensive coverage of facilitation techniques specifically tailored for agile team contexts.

The discussion begins with the fundamental principles of effective facilitation, including neutrality, process focus, and empowerment of participants. Adkins explains how these principles apply specifically to agile team facilitation and the unique challenges coaches face.

Various facilitation techniques are explored, including meeting design, energy management, conflict resolution, and decision-making processes. Each technique is presented with specific application to agile ceremonies and team interactions.

The chapter provides detailed guidance on facilitating specific agile ceremonies, including sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. For each ceremony, the author explains the facilitator's role, common challenges, and techniques for maximizing effectiveness.

Advanced facilitation skills are covered, including working with difficult participants, managing group dynamics, and facilitating virtual or distributed teams. Adkins provides practical strategies for handling each type of challenge while maintaining productive team interactions.

The chapter addresses the gradual transfer of facilitation responsibilities from coaches to teams, including how to teach team members to facilitate their own meetings and when to step back from active facilitation roles.

Tools and techniques for facilitation are discussed, including both physical and virtual tools that can enhance team collaboration and decision-making. The author provides guidance on selecting and using appropriate tools for different situations.

### Chapter 11: The Coach

This chapter focuses on professional coaching skills and their application in agile team contexts. Adkins draws on established coaching methodologies while adapting them specifically for the unique needs of agile teams and organizations.

The discussion begins with core coaching principles, including the belief in client capability, the power of questions over answers, and the importance of helping clients discover their own solutions. These principles are explored in the context of team coaching rather than individual coaching.

Key coaching skills are presented, including active listening, powerful questioning, observation, and reflection. Each skill is explained with specific application to agile team situations and examples of effective implementation.

The chapter covers different coaching models and frameworks that can be applied to team coaching, including GROW (Goal, Reality, Options, Way Forward) and other structured approaches. Adkins explains how to adapt these models for team rather than individual contexts.

The coaching conversation structure is explored, including how to open coaching conversations with teams, maintain focus on team-generated goals and solutions, and close conversations with clear commitments and next steps.

Advanced coaching techniques are discussed, including working with team emotions, addressing underlying beliefs and assumptions, and helping teams develop their own coaching capabilities. The author provides guidance on when and how to use these more sophisticated interventions.

The chapter addresses common challenges in team coaching, including managing different perspectives within teams, dealing with team resistance, and maintaining appropriate boundaries between coaching and other roles.

## Part IV: Growing Your Agile Coaching Skills

### Chapter 12: What's My Coaching Stance?

This chapter helps coaches develop the ability to consciously choose and shift between different coaching stances based on team needs and situational demands. Adkins emphasizes that masterful coaching involves fluid movement between teaching, mentoring, facilitating, and professional coaching stances.

The discussion begins with a framework for assessing team needs and matching appropriate coaching stances. The author provides diagnostic questions and observation techniques that help coaches determine which stance will be most effective in different situations.

Each coaching stance is revisited with specific guidance on recognizing when it's most appropriate, how to transition into it smoothly, and how to know when it's time to shift to a different stance. Adkins emphasizes the importance of conscious choice rather than habitual response patterns.

The chapter provides practical exercises and self-assessment tools that help coaches develop their ability to recognize their default stance preferences and expand their range of effective interventions. These tools include reflection questions, feedback gathering methods, and practice scenarios.

Common stance-related challenges are addressed, including coaches who default to teaching when coaching would be more effective, or those who avoid necessary mentoring because they believe it creates dependency. Strategies for overcoming these limitations are provided.

The concept of stance flexibility is explored, including how master coaches develop the ability to shift stances multiple times within a single interaction based on evolving team needs. This advanced skill is presented as a goal for coaches to work toward over time.

The chapter concludes with guidance on helping teams understand different coaching stances and when to request specific types of support, promoting more effective coach-team partnerships.

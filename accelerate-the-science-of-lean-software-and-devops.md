## Part One: What We Found

### Chapter 1: Accelerate

The opening chapter establishes the fundamental premise that technology is a competitive advantage in today's economy. Organizations that can deliver software faster, more reliably, and with higher quality will outperform their competitors. The authors introduce the concept that high performers can achieve both speed and stability simultaneously, challenging the conventional wisdom that suggests a trade-off between the two.

The chapter presents evidence from the research showing that high-performing organizations deploy code 46 times more frequently than low performers, with lead times that are 440 times faster. When failures occur, high performers recover 170 times faster and have change failure rates that are 7 times lower than low performers.

These dramatic differences in performance are not accidental but result from specific practices and capabilities that can be measured, learned, and implemented. The authors emphasize that these improvements are achievable for any organization willing to invest in the right approaches and cultural changes.

The research methodology is introduced, explaining how the authors used survey data, statistical analysis, and cluster analysis to identify high, medium, and low performers. This scientific approach differentiates the book from opinion-based management literature and provides credible evidence for the recommendations that follow.

### Chapter 2: Measuring Performance

This chapter introduces the four key metrics that define software delivery performance, which became known as the "DORA metrics" after the DevOps Research and Assessment team:

**Lead Time for Changes:** The time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production. This measures the speed of the software delivery process and indicates how quickly organizations can respond to customer needs or market changes.

**Deployment Frequency:** How often code is deployed to production. High performers deploy multiple times per day, while low performers deploy between once per week and once per month. Frequent deployments enable faster feedback and reduce the risk associated with large batch sizes.

**Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):** How quickly service can be restored after an incident or deployment causes a service impairment or outage. This metric measures the stability and resilience of systems and processes.

**Change Failure Rate:** The percentage of changes that result in degraded service or subsequently require remediation. This measures the quality of the deployment process and the effectiveness of testing and monitoring practices.

The authors explain why these metrics were chosen over alternatives like lines of code, velocity, or utilization. These four metrics focus on outcomes rather than outputs and provide a balanced view of both speed and stability. They are also predictive of broader organizational and business outcomes.

The chapter discusses common measurement pitfalls, such as focusing on individual productivity rather than team outcomes, or using metrics that can be gamed. The authors emphasize that metrics should drive the right behaviors and align with business objectives rather than optimizing for local improvements that may harm overall system performance.

### Chapter 3: Measuring and Changing Culture

Building on Ron Westrum's research on organizational culture, this chapter explores how culture impacts performance and can be measured and changed. The authors identify three types of organizational culture:

**Pathological (Power-oriented):** Organizations characterized by large amounts of fear and threat. Information is hoarded, messengers are shot, responsibilities are shirked, bridging is discouraged, and novelty is crushed.

**Bureaucratic (Rule-oriented):** Organizations characterized by rules and processes. Information may be ignored, messengers are neglected, responsibility is compartmentalized, bridging is tolerated, and novelty creates problems.

**Generative (Performance-oriented):** Organizations focused on the mission. Information is actively sought, messengers are trained, responsibilities are shared, bridging is rewarded, and novelty is implemented.

The research demonstrates that organizations with generative cultures have better information flow, higher cooperation and trust, bridging between teams, and conscious inquiry. These cultural characteristics directly contribute to better software delivery performance and organizational outcomes.

The chapter provides practical guidance on how to measure culture using survey instruments and how to improve culture through implementing technical practices, lean management practices, and continuous delivery capabilities. This is significant because it shows that culture can be changed through concrete practices rather than hoping for cultural transformation through values statements or training alone.

The authors present evidence that good culture predicts job satisfaction, organizational performance, and lower burnout. They also show that technical practices and lean management practices contribute to building better culture, creating a virtuous cycle of improvement.

### Chapter 4: Technical Practices

This chapter examines the technical practices that enable high performance, focusing on continuous delivery, architecture, and quality practices. The research identifies specific capabilities that contribute to software delivery performance:

**Version Control:** All application code, system configuration, application configuration, and build scripts should be stored in version control. This provides the foundation for repeatability, traceability, and collaboration.

**Deployment Automation:** The degree to which deployments are fully automated and do not require manual intervention. Automated deployments reduce errors, increase consistency, and enable frequent releases.

**Continuous Integration:** Code is regularly checked into version control and integrated with the main branch. This practice includes running automated tests on every commit to catch integration issues early.

**Trunk-based Development:** Developers work in small batches off the master branch rather than long-lived feature branches. This reduces merge conflicts and enables faster integration and feedback.

**Test Automation:** Automated tests are reliable, fast, and provide good coverage of the application. Developers can run tests on their workstations, tests run quickly, and automated tests are run as part of the deployment pipeline.

**Test Data Management:** Test data is adequately provisioned for automated testing, and teams can acquire test data on demand without dependencies on other teams.

**Shift Left on Security:** Security practices are integrated into the software development process rather than being treated as a separate phase. This includes security reviews, security testing, and involving security teams in design decisions.

**Loosely Coupled Architecture:** Teams can make large-scale changes to their systems without depending on other teams to make changes to their systems. Architecture enables small, independent teams to work effectively.

The chapter presents statistical evidence showing how these practices contribute to software delivery performance. Organizations implementing these practices see significant improvements in their ability to deliver software quickly and reliably.

The authors emphasize that these practices work together as a system. Implementing individual practices in isolation may provide some benefit, but the real gains come from implementing them as an integrated approach to software delivery.

### Chapter 5: Architecture

This chapter challenges conventional wisdom about software architecture by demonstrating that certain architectural characteristics enable or constrain an organization's ability to deliver software effectively. The research shows that architecture has a significant impact on software delivery performance, but not in the ways many people expect.

The key finding is that **loosely coupled architecture** is the strongest predictor of high performance among architectural characteristics. Organizations with loosely coupled architectures can make large-scale changes to their systems without requiring coordination with other teams or creating dependencies that slow down delivery.

The chapter identifies several characteristics of architectures that enable high performance:

**Testability:** The system is designed to be testable, with clear interfaces and dependencies that can be easily mocked or stubbed. This enables comprehensive automated testing and faster feedback cycles.

**Deployability:** Components can be deployed independently without coordinating with other services or requiring downtime. This enables frequent deployments and reduces the risk and complexity of releases.

**Loosely Coupled Architecture:** Teams can choose their tools and technologies independently, make large-scale changes to their systems without depending on other teams, do most of their testing without requiring an integrated environment, and deploy and release their product independently.

The research shows that architectural decisions made years ago continue to impact an organization's ability to deliver software effectively. Organizations with tightly coupled architectures find it increasingly difficult to maintain delivery speed as they scale, while those with loosely coupled architectures can maintain or even improve their performance.

Interestingly, the study found that **low-risk releases** are more predictable than architectural types. Whether an organization uses microservices, service-oriented architecture, or even well-designed monoliths matters less than whether they can make low-risk releases that don't require coordinating with other teams.

The chapter also addresses the myth that you cannot achieve both speed and stability. The data clearly shows that high performers achieve better outcomes on both dimensions, suggesting that the practices and architectural decisions that enable speed also contribute to stability.

### Chapter 6: Integrating Infosec into the Delivery Lifecycle

This chapter presents research on how security practices impact software delivery performance, challenging the traditional approach of treating security as a gate at the end of the development process. The authors introduce the concept of "shifting left on security" and demonstrate its benefits through empirical data.

The research identifies key security practices that high-performing organizations implement:

**Security Integration:** Security work is integrated into the software development process rather than being done as a separate phase by a separate team. This includes involving security teams in design and architecture decisions from the beginning.

**Preapproved Security Libraries:** Development teams have access to preapproved libraries, packages, toolchains, and processes that meet security requirements. This enables developers to implement secure solutions without waiting for security team approval for each decision.

**Security Testing:** Security features and security testing are integrated into the automated testing suite. This includes static analysis, dynamic analysis, and dependency scanning as part of the continuous integration pipeline.

**Continuous Security:** Security practices are applied continuously throughout the development and deployment process rather than as point-in-time activities. This includes monitoring, alerting, and response capabilities that operate in production environments.

The data shows that organizations implementing these "shifting left" security practices achieve better security outcomes without sacrificing delivery performance. In fact, organizations with integrated security practices often perform better on software delivery metrics than those treating security as a separate phase.

The chapter addresses common concerns about security slowing down delivery by showing that the opposite is true. Organizations that integrate security into their development process can move faster and more safely than those that treat security as an afterthought or external constraint.

This research has significant implications for how organizations structure their security teams and processes. Rather than serving as gatekeepers who review and approve work after it's done, security teams can be more effective as enablers who provide tools, processes, and guidance that allow development teams to implement security throughout their work.

## Part Two: The Research

### Chapter 7: Management Practices for Software

This chapter examines management practices that contribute to high performance in software organizations, drawing on lean management principles adapted for knowledge work. The research identifies specific management capabilities that predict better software delivery performance and organizational outcomes.

**Lean Management Practices:** The study found that organizations implementing lean management practices achieve better results across multiple dimensions. These practices include:

- **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP):** Teams maintain focus by limiting the amount of work in progress and making work visible through tools like kanban boards. This prevents context switching and enables faster flow.

- **Visual Management:** Using visual displays to monitor quality, productivity, and other key metrics makes problems visible and enables faster response to issues.

- **Working in Small Batches:** Breaking work into small, manageable pieces that can be completed quickly enables faster feedback and reduces risk.

- **Proactive Monitoring:** Implementing comprehensive monitoring and alerting allows teams to detect and resolve issues before they impact users.

**Lean Product Development:** High-performing organizations implement lean principles in their product development processes:

- **Customer Collaboration:** Working closely with customers to understand their needs and validate solutions before building them.

- **Team Experimentation:** Empowering teams to try out new ideas and innovative solutions without requiring extensive approval processes.

- **Incorporating Customer Feedback:** Having the authority and processes to incorporate customer feedback without requiring approval from outside the team.

**Continuous Improvement:** High performers establish cultures and processes for continuous improvement:

- **Learning Culture:** Organizations that encourage learning from failures and continuously improving processes perform better than those that punish mistakes.

- **Time for Learning:** Providing dedicated time for improvement work, learning, and innovation rather than being 100% allocated to feature development.

The research demonstrates that these management practices work synergistically with technical practices to drive performance improvements. Organizations implementing both technical and management practices achieve better results than those focusing on only one dimension.

The chapter also addresses the role of leadership in enabling these practices. Leaders in high-performing organizations create psychological safety, support their teams' efforts to improve, and remove obstacles that prevent teams from implementing better practices.

### Chapter 8: Product Development

This chapter explores how product development practices impact software delivery performance, examining the relationship between how organizations develop products and their ability to deliver software effectively. The research reveals that organizations taking a lean approach to product development achieve better outcomes across multiple dimensions.

**Lean Product Development Capabilities:** The study identifies specific product development practices that contribute to high performance:

**Team Authority:** High-performing teams have the authority to create and change specifications during the development process without requiring approval from outside the team. This enables faster response to changing requirements and new information.

**Customer Collaboration:** Teams work directly with customers to understand their needs, validate solutions, and incorporate feedback. This reduces the risk of building features that customers don't value and improves product-market fit.

**Team Experimentation:** Organizations that allow teams to try out new ideas without extensive approval processes can innovate faster and discover better solutions. This includes both technical experiments and product experiments.

**Continuous Feedback:** Teams can incorporate customer feedback directly into their products without requiring approval from outside the team. This creates shorter feedback loops and enables more responsive product development.

**Working in Small Batches:** Breaking product development work into small, testable increments enables faster learning and reduces the risk of large-scale failures. Small batches also enable more frequent releases and faster time to market.

**Team Visibility:** Teams have good visibility into the flow of work through the development process, including work in progress and bottlenecks. This visibility enables better planning and faster identification of problems.

**The Impact on Performance:** Organizations implementing these lean product development practices achieve better software delivery performance and business outcomes. The research shows strong statistical correlations between product development practices and:

- Faster lead times for changes
- Higher deployment frequency  
- Faster recovery from failures
- Lower change failure rates
- Better organizational performance
- Higher employee job satisfaction

**Breaking Down Silos:** The chapter emphasizes how lean product development practices help break down organizational silos that slow delivery. When product teams have authority to make decisions and access to customer feedback, they can move more quickly without waiting for approvals or handoffs to other teams.

**Continuous Learning:** Lean product development emphasizes learning over being right. Organizations that embrace experimentation and learning from failures can adapt more quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs.

This research challenges traditional project management approaches that emphasize detailed upfront planning, extensive approval processes, and handing work between specialized teams. Instead, it supports approaches that emphasize team autonomy, customer collaboration, and continuous learning.

### Chapter 9: Making Work Sustainable

This chapter addresses one of the most important but often overlooked aspects of high performance: sustainability. The research demonstrates that sustainable practices not only improve employee well-being but also contribute to better organizational performance and business outcomes.

**Deployment Pain:** The study measures deployment pain through survey questions about whether deployments are fearful, anxious, difficult, or disruptive events. Organizations with high deployment pain experience:

- Lower software delivery performance
- Higher employee burnout  
- Reduced organizational performance
- More unplanned work and rework

Conversely, organizations where deployments are routine, low-risk events achieve better performance across all measured dimensions. This finding reinforces the importance of implementing continuous delivery practices that make deployments safe, reliable, and frequent.

**Burnout Research:** Drawing on Christina Maslach's research on burnout, the study examines three dimensions of burnout in technology organizations:

**Exhaustion:** Feeling overextended and depleted of emotional and physical resources. This is often caused by excessive workload, unrealistic deadlines, and insufficient recovery time.

**Depersonalization (Cynicism):** Developing cynical attitudes toward work, colleagues, and customers. This often results from feeling powerless to influence outcomes or seeing one's work as meaningless.

**Personal Accomplishment:** Feeling effective and accomplished in one's work. Burnout is characterized by reduced feelings of personal accomplishment and effectiveness.

**Factors that Reduce Burnout:** The research identifies specific organizational practices that reduce burnout:

- **Organizational Investment in DevOps:** Organizations that invest in DevOps practices and transformation see reduced burnout among their employees.

- **Lean Management Practices:** Implementing lean practices like limiting work in progress and working in small batches reduces stress and increases job satisfaction.

- **Continuous Delivery:** Organizations with effective continuous delivery practices experience less deployment pain and lower burnout.

- **Generative Culture:** Organizations with generative cultures that emphasize learning, collaboration, and shared responsibility have lower burnout rates.

- **Job Resources:** Providing employees with the tools, information, and support they need to do their jobs effectively reduces burnout.

**The Business Case for Sustainability:** The chapter presents compelling evidence that sustainable practices benefit both employees and organizations:

- Organizations with lower burnout rates achieve better software delivery performance
- Sustainable practices contribute to better organizational performance and profitability
- Organizations with sustainable practices have lower turnover and higher employee engagement
- Sustainable organizations can maintain high performance over longer periods

**Practical Implications:** The research suggests several practical approaches for making work more sustainable:

- Invest in automation and tooling that reduces manual, error-prone work
- Implement practices that make deployments routine and low-risk
- Create organizational cultures that support learning and continuous improvement
- Provide employees with the autonomy and resources they need to do their jobs effectively
- Measure and address factors that contribute to burnout

This chapter is particularly significant because it demonstrates that high performance is not about working harder or longer hours, but about working smarter through better practices, tools, and organizational culture.

## Part Three: Transformation

### Chapter 10: Employee Satisfaction, Identity, and Engagement

This chapter explores the relationship between software delivery practices and employee outcomes, demonstrating that organizations implementing DevOps practices not only achieve better technical and business results but also create more satisfying work environments for their employees.

**Net Promoter Score for Employment:** The research adapts the Net Promoter Score concept to measure employee satisfaction by asking: "How likely is it that you would recommend your organization as a great place to work to a friend or colleague?" This Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) provides a single metric for measuring employee advocacy and satisfaction.

The study finds strong correlations between software delivery performance and employee satisfaction. Organizations with high-performing software delivery practices have employees who are more likely to recommend their organization as a great place to work.

**Identity and Meaningful Work:** The research explores how DevOps practices contribute to employees finding their work more meaningful and identifying more strongly with their organizations. Key findings include:

**Professional Identity:** Employees in high-performing organizations report stronger identification with their professional roles and greater pride in their work. This is partly because these organizations enable employees to use their skills effectively and see the impact of their contributions.

**Organizational Identity:** Employees in high-performing organizations are more likely to identify with their organization's mission and values. This strong identification contributes to better performance and lower turnover.

**Meaningful Work:** DevOps practices contribute to making work more meaningful by:
- Reducing frustrating, manual work through automation
- Enabling employees to focus on higher-value activities
- Providing faster feedback on the impact of their work
- Creating more opportunities for learning and growth

**Learning Culture:** The chapter emphasizes the importance of learning culture in employee satisfaction. Organizations that encourage learning from failures, provide time for experimentation and learning, and support employee development create more engaged workforces.

**Psychological Safety:** Drawing on Amy Edmondson's research on psychological safety, the study shows that employees who feel safe to express their opinions, ask questions, and discuss mistakes are more satisfied with their work and perform better. DevOps practices contribute to psychological safety by:
- Making work and problems visible through monitoring and metrics
- Encouraging experimentation and learning from failures
- Reducing blame and finger-pointing when things go wrong
- Creating shared responsibility for outcomes

**Career Development:** High-performing organizations provide better opportunities for career development and growth. Employees report greater satisfaction when they have opportunities to learn new skills, take on new challenges, and advance their careers.

**Work-Life Balance:** Contrary to common stereotypes about high-performing organizations demanding excessive hours, the research shows that organizations with better software delivery practices often provide better work-life balance. This is achieved through:
- Reducing manual, error-prone work that requires out-of-hours support
- Implementing reliable monitoring and alerting that prevents fire-fighting
- Creating more predictable delivery processes that reduce crisis situations
- Automating routine tasks that previously required manual intervention

**The Virtuous Cycle:** The chapter describes a virtuous cycle where better software delivery practices lead to higher employee satisfaction, which in turn contributes to better performance. Satisfied employees are more likely to:
- Stay with the organization, reducing turnover costs
- Contribute discretionary effort to improve processes and outcomes  
- Collaborate effectively with colleagues
- Recommend the organization to talented candidates

This research provides compelling evidence that DevOps is not just about technology but about creating better work environments that benefit both employees and organizations.

### Chapter 11: Leaders and Managers

This chapter examines the crucial role of leadership in driving successful DevOps transformations and high-performing technology organizations. The research identifies specific leadership behaviors and organizational practices that enable transformation and sustained high performance.

**Transformational Leadership:** The study draws on established leadership research to examine how transformational leadership contributes to DevOps success. Transformational leaders demonstrate five key behaviors:

**Vision:** Transformational leaders have a clear, compelling vision for where the organization needs to go and can communicate this vision effectively to their teams. In DevOps contexts, this means understanding how technology can drive business outcomes and articulating the benefits of transformation.

**Inspirational Communication:** These leaders can motivate and inspire others through their communication, creating enthusiasm for change and improvement. They help teams understand the purpose behind DevOps practices and how these practices contribute to broader organizational goals.

**Intellectual Stimulation:** Transformational leaders encourage their teams to think differently about problems and challenge assumptions. They promote innovation and continuous improvement rather than accepting the status quo.

**Supportive Leadership:** These leaders demonstrate genuine care for their team members' well-being and development. They provide support, encouragement, and resources needed for teams to succeed in their transformation efforts.

**Personal Recognition:** Transformational leaders recognize and celebrate individual contributions and achievements. They understand that transformation requires individual behavior change and acknowledge people who embrace new practices.

**The Impact of Leadership:** The research demonstrates strong statistical relationships between transformational leadership and multiple outcomes:

- Software delivery performance
- Organizational performance  
- Employee job satisfaction and engagement
- Organizational culture
- Burnout reduction

Organizations with transformational leaders achieve better results across all measured dimensions, demonstrating that leadership is a critical factor in DevOps success.

**Leadership Practices for DevOps:** The chapter identifies specific practices that leaders can implement to support DevOps transformation:

**Remove Obstacles:** High-performing leaders actively identify and remove obstacles that prevent their teams from implementing better practices. This includes addressing organizational policies, processes, and structures that inhibit flow.

**Provide Resources:** Leaders in successful transformations ensure their teams have the tools, training, and resources needed to implement DevOps practices effectively. This includes investment in automation tools, training programs, and dedicated time for improvement work.

**Create Psychological Safety:** Leaders play a crucial role in creating psychological safety by modeling curiosity rather than blame when problems occur, encouraging experimentation and learning, and protecting teams from external pressure during transformation efforts.

**Support Experimentation:** High-performing leaders encourage their teams to try new approaches and learn from failures. They provide air cover for teams to experiment with new practices and tools without fear of punishment if experiments don't succeed.

**Invest in People:** Transformational leaders invest in their people's development through training, mentoring, and providing opportunities for growth. They understand that transformation requires new skills and capabilities.

**Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Leaders play a crucial role in breaking down organizational silos by encouraging collaboration across teams and departments. They model collaborative behavior and remove barriers to cross-functional work.

**The Middle Management Challenge:** The chapter addresses the particular challenges faced by middle managers during DevOps transformations. Middle managers often face conflicting pressures from senior leadership demanding transformation and teams that may be resistant to change. The research suggests that successful transformations require:

- Clear communication about the purpose and benefits of transformation
- Support and training for middle managers to develop new leadership capabilities
- Alignment between senior leadership expectations and middle management capabilities
- Recognition that middle managers need time and support to change their own practices

**Servant Leadership:** The research also examines servant leadership principles and their application to DevOps contexts. Servant leaders focus on serving their teams by removing obstacles, providing support, and enabling their teams' success rather than commanding and controlling their actions.

This chapter emphasizes that DevOps transformation is not just about implementing new tools and practices but requires fundamental changes in how leaders think about their roles and responsibilities. Leadership development is therefore a critical component of any successful DevOps transformation.

**Implementation Strategy:** The authors recommend a systematic approach to implementing these capabilities:

**Start Where You Are:** Organizations should begin by assessing their current state across all capability areas and identifying the most impactful improvements they can make given their current constraints and context.

**Focus on Capabilities, Not Maturity:** Rather than trying to achieve a particular "maturity level," organizations should focus on developing specific capabilities that will improve their performance. Different capabilities may be at different levels of development, and that's acceptable.

**Measure Progress:** Organizations should establish baseline measurements for the four key metrics (lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to recovery, and change failure rate) and track their progress over time.

**Invest in Learning:** Transformation requires learning new skills and capabilities. Organizations should invest in training, experimentation, and providing time for teams to develop new practices.

**Address Systemic Issues:** Many obstacles to high performance are systemic issues that require leadership attention. Organizations must be willing to change policies, processes, and organizational structures that inhibit flow.

**The Research Continues:** The authors note that this research represents a snapshot of understanding as of 2018 and that the field continues to evolve. They encourage organizations to participate in ongoing research efforts and to contribute their own learnings to the broader community.

**Final Thoughts:** The book concludes by emphasizing that high performance in technology organizations is not about working harder or longer hours, but about working smarter through evidence-based practices. The research demonstrates that organizations can achieve remarkable improvements in their performance by implementing the capabilities and practices identified in the study.

The transformation journey requires sustained effort, leadership commitment, and cultural change, but the benefits extend far beyond just technology outcomes. Organizations that successfully implement these practices see improvements in:

- Business performance and competitiveness
- Employee satisfaction and retention
- Customer satisfaction and loyalty  
- Organizational resilience and adaptability
- Innovation and learning capabilities

The book's fundamental message is that technology transformation is possible for any organization willing to commit to evidence-based practices and continuous improvement. The research provides a roadmap for this transformation based on data from thousands of organizations worldwide, offering hope and practical guidance for technology leaders seeking to drive meaningful change in their organizations.
